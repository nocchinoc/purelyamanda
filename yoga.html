        <div class="firsttext"><p>I discovered yoga while attending college. I quickly realized it was the most powerful
          tool for me to manage my stress and learn to take better care of my body following a miserable
          decade of extreme dieting and obsessive gym visits. I fell in love with yoga immediately. For
          a while, it was more of a privilege or treat; dropping in to local studios when I had some
          extra cash or wherever donation classes were offered. When I arrived on contract to spend a
          year in South Korea, I spent a lot of my downtime focused on educating myself further and
          practicing almost daily.</p></div>
        <div class="secondtext"><p>During this time, I knew deep in my bones that I wanted to teach yoga
          on some sort of level. As fate would have it, I had the unique opportunity of inheriting a
          weekend beach yoga class an instructor was giving up as she was ending her contract and leaving
          the country. Each week the class grew as expats from all over the world joined me every Saturday
          morning on Gwangali Beach, Busan, South Korea. As the class size grew, so did my confidence.
          And as my contract ended, I knew my next stop was yoga teacher training. I chose Yoga Tree
          (now Yoga Works) in San Francisco and in the matter of one incredible month, earned my
          certification and followed my first teaching gig back in Tampa, FL.</p></div>

        <div class="thirdtext"><p>I've been in the Tampa
          Bay Area ever since, growing, evolving and becoming the best yoga instructor I yearn to be.
          I never know what opportunity may pop up next, but one thing I know for sure is that I have
          finally found my true calling. You can catch me on schedule at various studios teaching all
          styles of yoga including vinyasa flow, yin, restorative, hatha and guided meditation. I also
          recently introduced my new specialized workshop entitled "YogArtiste: When Art, Music and Yoga
          Collide". I am also available for private instruction both individual and small groups. You
          can reach out to me HERE for inquiry. (Insert email into hyperlink)</p></div>
