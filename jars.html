          After fifteen years hopping from fad diet to fad diet and one food trend to the next, I finally
          settled down on my personal food mantra: Eat Real Food. When I read about the myriad of gut and
          mind disorders that far too many people fall victim to (including myself!) the common thread I
          find are people's diets drenched in highly processed or modified foods. After experiencing events
          in my life where I have been misdiagnosed with anything from Irritbal Bowel Syndrome to Chronic
          Fatigue</p></div>
        <div class="secondtext"><p>Syndrome to Rheumatoid Arthritis and suffering bouts of severe depression, I found the
        common link was whether low calorie or not, the more modified foods I consumed, the worse I felt.
        Once these foods were highly restricted from my diet, did I begin to heal, settle into a beautiful
        body weight and shape and view life with a much sunnier outlook. The truth is, you have to cook
        and prepare goods from Mother Earth and consume them more often. Don't have time? That's where
        Pure Jars comes in. These are whole-food, plant-based, full meals in mason jars.  You can eat
        them on the go; just drop the dressing in and shake! Or you can combine them at home with any
        additional ingredients you'd like to add. Mason jars are also easily reusable. They can come in
        handy to hold anything from cotton swabs to screws and nails. They can hold flowers or even
        your favorite beer. They can even be returned after use and prepped for your next order.
