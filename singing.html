    <p>I am a child of the performing arts. While fellow school kids were chauffeured to their
      after-school soccer, lacrosse or volleyball practices, I could always be found wherever
      the nearest stage was located. Thank goodness my parents fully supported this obsession
      of mine because I breathed everything arts! What began in school plays, rolled into summer
      theater camp, then local community theater and even into my current involvement in Improv.
      Meanwhile, in the background, I spent my teenage angst writing songs and secretly performing
      them for my friends. To be honest, while I owned my acting skills, it took me quite a while
      to grow into my singing skills. But my passion for music was ever-present and quite diverse.
      When it comes to singing, my sound is highly influenced from artists including Diana Krall,
      Sara Barielles, Nina Simone, Norah Jones and Sarah McLachlan. In time, my vocals took on a
      blend of jazz, soul and folk. Three years ago I met a talented musician, and together, we
      bring our sounds to yoga studios, weddings, private events and bars around the Tampa Bay Area.
