      <div class="firsttext"><p>Hi! I'm Amanda. Welcome to my personal website! A one-stop-shop where you
          can learn a little more about me and all my ventures. This particular page shares a little more
          about my background. Feel free to click on any of my other tabs above regarding my current
          projects.</p>

          <p>As a child, I moved with my family often. My interests and talents are a collection of my
          experiences gained over time. I grew to love change and found excitement in trying new things
          and meeting new people. From a young age, I developed a steady involvement in the performing
          arts. I grew quite comfortable being in front of a crowd. In fact, I thrived.</p></div>
          
      <div class="secondtext"><p>Today, you can find me any given day of the week front and center whether
          leading a large studio yoga class, singing on stage at local events or making people laugh at
          my local improv theater. But my ability to juggle all these passions of mine didn't happen
          overnight...</p>

          <p>I earned my Education degree at the University of Florida and I gave teaching a
          good go but found in my heart, a school environment just wasn't my true calling. So I sought out
          travel to help me figure out what to do next in my life. I spent time living in both Italy and
          South Korea, earning an income as an English teacher.</p></div>
      <div class="secondphoto"></div>
      <div class="thirdphoto"></div>
      <div class="thirdtext"><p>What I didn’t expect
        was the amount of growth and self-discovery that I found along the way.  Especially my desire to
        earn my yoga teaching certification shortly after in San Francisco. You can learn more about my
        yoga career and offerings <span class="yogalink"><a href="yoga.html">HERE.</a></span> I attribute
        my confidence to pursue all of my passions today from my time spent living abroad, including my
        dedication to promoting healthy eating and positive body image awareness for all women. You can
        check out a very heartfelt memoir about this HERE >insert link to BadYogi article<.</p>

        <p>Recently, I hatched a side passion-project: plant-based, whole foods meals in Mason jars I aptly
        call Pure Jars. You can learn more about these little bundles of nourishment
        <a href="jars.html">HERE.</a></p>

        <p>There’s no way of knowing what I will get into next! While my wanderlust always calls for me,
        I'm appreciating every day having the privilege of living a life doing exactly what I love.
        Currently holding down the fort in St. Petersburg, FL, I invite you to reach out for any inquires
        regarding yoga, Pure Jars or singing for hire.</p></div>

      <p>Hi! I'm Amanda. I guess you can call me a modern day Jane-of-all-trades. As a child,
        I moved with my family often, and just like my addresses, my interests and talents were
        collected over time. I grew to love change and found excitement in trying new things
        and meeting new people. From a young age, I developed a steady involvement in the performing
        arts from grade-school plays to Summer theater camp. I grew quite comfortable being in
        front of a crowd. In fact, I thrived. Now, as an adult, you can find me any given day of
        the week front and center whether leading a large studio yoga class, singing on stage at
        local events or making people laugh at my local improv theater.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="secondp">
        <p>My ability to juggle all these passions of mine didn’t happen overnight. Back in the day,
          I earned my Bachelors and Masters degrees at the University of Florida. I tried teaching,
          but found in my heart, a school environment just wasn't my true calling. So I sought out
          travel to help me figure out what to do next in my life. Oh, the lost, soul-searching
          decade of my twenties! I spent some time living in both Italy and South Korea, earning an
          income as an English teacher. Guess that degree helped in the end! What I didn’t expect
          was the amount of growth and self-discovery that I found along the way.  Especially my
          desire to move on to earn my 200 hr RYT yoga teaching certification shortly after in San
          Francisco. You can learn more about my yoga career and offerings <span class="yogalink">

        <p>I definitely attribute my growing confidence to pursue all of my passions today from my
          time spent living abroad, including my passion and calling for promoting healthy eating
